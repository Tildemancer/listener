# Stamps Listener.toc's "## Version:" line with the current git version
# (nearest tag, or the short commit hash if there's no tag yet) every time
# the working tree changes. This is the local, no-CI substitute for the
# "@@addon_version@@" token that the CurseForge forgepush pipeline fills in
# on tagged releases -- that token is left untouched in the committed TOC
# so forgepush still works, this just patches the *working copy* so a git
# checkout of this repo shows a real version in-game without needing a
# release build.
#
# Installed via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` and called from the
# post-checkout / post-merge hooks in this same directory.
